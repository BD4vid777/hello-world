# hello-world
Welcome Repository

I'm a new to this World, world of developers.
My target is to become first a FrontEnd and then keep going to upgrade to be a FullStack.

I give myself 1 year and few days/months to make it happen. I'm totally green in this stuff, so there's a lot for me to learn.

I think, this is it for know, for U to know.
